# ksqlDB Workshop 

## Introduction 

ksqlDB is the streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka. This workshop will step through some practical examples of how to use ksqlDB to build powerful stream-processing applications:    
- Filtering streams of data   
- Joining live streams of events with reference data (e.g. from a database)     
- Continuous, stateful aggregations     

## testing the setup

First things first, let’s get connected to the lab environment and make sure we have access to everything we need.     

### Open the Confluent Cloud Dashboard 

Prior to the workshop you should have recieved an email to login to Confluent Cloud. To ensure you have the necessary access, navigate to the [Confluent Cloud Dashboard](https://confluent.cloud/) and confirm the following:     
- There is an environment created entitled "vip_dev_ksql_env"     
- Ensure there is a cluster called "vip_transformations" 
- Open the cluster and ensure you have the appropriate Connectors (2 datagen connectors) and topics (2 topics) set up.    
- Click on ksqlDB and ensure you have a cluster provisioned.     

### Syntax Reference

You will find it helpful to keep a copy of the KSQL syntax guide open in another browser tab: [Syntax Reference](https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/0.17.0-ksqldb/reference/)     

## ksqlDB

ksqlDB can be accessed via either the command line interface (CLI), a graphical UI built into the Confluent Cloud Dashboard, or the REST API.    

In this workshop we will mainly be using the Confluent Cloud Dashboard. To learn more about using the REST API and the CLI, please reference this [blog post](https://rmoff.net/2021/03/24/connecting-to-managed-ksqldb-in-confluent-cloud-with-rest-and-ksqldb-cli/).       

### Looking Around

You will find your ksqlDB cluster by navigating to the kafka cluster with your username and selecting "ksqlDB" on the left-hand menu. When we create streams and tables they will appear on the right side of the screen under "All available streams and tables". You'll also see the following tabs in the ksqlDB interface:     
- **Editor**    
- **Flow**     
- **Streams**    
- **Tables**    
- **Persistent Queries**     
- **Performance**    
- **Settings**     
- **CLI Instructions**     

### See available kafka topics and data 

Remember we discussed in the presentation that KSQL works with Streams and Tables, and these are just abstractions for working with data in topics ? So the first thing we will do is find what topics we have available to work with on our Kafka cluster - try entering:    
```
show topics;
```

The list of topics you see here is exactly the same as you would see in the 'Topics' section of Cloud Dashboard, except that here we are getting the list via a KSQL command instead of browsing graphically for it.     

We can also investigate some data from those topics before working with them:      
```
print 'xxxx' limit 3 
```
or
```
print 'xxxx' from beginning limit 3;
```

The topics we will use today are ratings and users.      

The event stream driving this example (the data in the ratings topic) is a simulated stream of events representing the ratings left by users on a mobile app or website, with fields including the device type that they used, the star rating (a score from 1 to 5), and an optional comment associated with the rating.     

Notice that we don’t need to know the format of the data when printing a topic; ksqlDB introspects the data and understands how to deserialize it.     
To stop the query, press the "stop" button.     

## Getting Started with DDL     

### Create the Ratings data stream 

Register the RATINGS data as a KSQL stream, sourced from the 'ratings' topic.   
```
create stream ratings with (kafka_topic='ratings', value_format='avro');
```

Notice that here we are using the Schema Registry with our json_sr-formatted data to pull in the schema of this stream automatically. If interested, you can compare the schema which ksqlDB has created here against what was registered in the Schema Registry in the Confluent Cloud Dashboard (they will be the same!) If our data were in some other format which can’t be described in the Schema Registry, such as CSV messages, then we would also need to specify each column and it’s datatype in the create statement.     

Check your creation with describe ratings; and then run a couple of select queries. For example:      

```
select *
from ratings
where channel like 'iOS%'
emit changes;
```

What happens? Why?     

The emit changes at the end of your select query is basically telling ksqlDB to keep following the topic which underlies your stream. As new records are written into that topic, ksqlDB will read them, filter them through the where clause, and write back to your terminal any events which pass the specified condition. In other words, this query will never end! This is one of the key differences about a streaming database.      

You can also try describe ratings extended; to see more technical information about the data flowing htrough your new stream.     

### Create the Users data stream and table 

Register the USERS data as a KSQL stream, sourced from the 'users' topic.        
```
create stream users with (kafka_topic='users', value_format='avro');
```

By default, all Kafka client applications when they start up will consume messages which arrive in their input topics from that moment forwards. Older records in the topic are not consumed. We can control this behavior though by setting a configuration property, called 'auto.offset.reset'. Change auto.offset.reset to 'Earliest' through the UI. If you are using the CLI, you can do this with the command:     

```
set 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';
```

Create a stream of the first 15 users.     
```
create stream users_15 as select * from users where user_id<=15;
```

Create a ktable based on the first 15 users.    

```
CREATE TABLE users_tbl AS
  SELECT user_id, latest_by_offset(first_name) AS first_name, latest_by_offset(last_name) AS last_name, latest_by_offset(level) AS level
  FROM users_15
  GROUP BY user_id
  EMIT CHANGES;
```


View the users table.     
```
select * from users_tbl emit changes;
```

### Identify the Unhappy Customers

Now that we have both our ratings and our user data, we can join them together to find out details about the users who are posting negative reviews, and see if any of them are our valued platinum customers. We start by finding just the low-scoring ratings (play around with the where clause conditions to experiment).     

```
select * from ratings where stars < 3 and channel like 'iOS%' emit changes limit 5;
```

Now convert this test query into a persistent one (a persistent query is one which starts with create and continuously writes its' output into a topic in Kafka):    

```
create stream poor_ratings as select * from ratings where stars < 3 and channel like 'iOS%';
```

How can we see the users who posted a poor rating? To answer this we need to join our users table:     
```
create stream poor_ratings_users as
select r.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.level, r.stars
from poor_ratings r
left join users_tbl u
on r.user_id = u.user_id;
```
### Using tables as a Materialized Cache

One really interesting way to use ksqlDB is to think of a continuously-updating table as a kind of Materialized View or Cache (it isn’t strictly either, technically speaking, but they are a good analogy here!) For example, we could also use one of our streams of ratings events to populate a table of aggregated, per-user, statistics:     

```
create table rating_stats as
select user_id,
    avg(stars) as avg_rating,
    collect_list(stars) as ratings,
    count(*) as num_ratings,
    max(rowtime) as last_rating_time
from ratings
group by user_id;
```

We can actually query this table in two different ways: 
- With a never-ending query, using emit changes, which will continuously output any changes in the table data back to our client.     
- As more of a "point look-up", which will simply give us the current value for a row in the table and then terminate. This should be familiar as it’s how most databases work :-).   

We sometimes refer to these 2 different ways to query as 'push' (the one which keeps sending change data back to us) and 'pull' (the moment-in-time lookup). We can try it both ways with the table we just built, like this:    
```
select * from rating_stats where user_id = 1 emit changes;
select * from rating_stats where user_id = 1;
```
See the difference?        

The first one (the emit changes) can be helpful when testing, or as the input to another create stream as… where you want the processing to continue for as long as new data is arriving. The second form (the lookup or 'pull query') can be useful if you have another application which wants to know the current value of something, perhaps in order to display it in a UI or use it in some other calculation. Because you can issue this query over ksqlDB’s REST API it allows you to think of your ksqlDB apps as though they were like special microservices or cache servers, always running in the background, ready to serve up the latest state at any time.     

### Monitoring our Queries

So what’s actually happening under the covers here? Let’s see all our running queries:
```
show queries;
explain <query_id>;  (case sensitive!)
```

...or you can go to the persistent queries tab in the UI!

### View Consumer Lag for a Query

Navigate to 'Clients' -> 'Consumer Lag' in the CC Dashboard and try to find the one for our join query and click on it.

All the names are prefixed with 'confluent_ksql' plus the ID of the query, as shown in the output of explain queries. What do we see?    

## Extra Credit

Time permitting, let’s explore the following idea:    

which customers are so upset that they post multiple bad ratings in quick succession? Perhaps we want to route those complaints direct to our Customer Care team to do some outreach…   

```
select first_name, last_name, count(*) as rating_count
from poor_ratings_users
window tumbling (size 5 minutes)
group by first_name, last_name
having count(*) > 1 emit changes;
```

This may take a minute or two to return any data as we are now waiting for the random data generator which populates the orginal 'ratings' to produce the needed set of output.    

And of course we could prefix this query with create table very_unhappy_vips as … to continuously record the output.
